The GNOME Shell Browser Plugin provides integration with gnome-shell and the
corresponding extensions repository, codenamed "SweetTooth". The plugin allows
the extensions repository to provide good integration, letting the website
know which extensions are enabled and disabled, and allowing the website to
enable, disable and install them.

Bugs should be reported at http://bugzilla.gnome.org against the 'gnome-shell'
product.
